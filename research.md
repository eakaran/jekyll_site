My research interests primarily lie in functional morphology and phylogenetics. I am currently at UCLA 
under the mentorship of Prof. Michael Alfaro. 

As an undergraduate research assistant, I've done field work pertaining to anemonefish cohabitation, 
sponge photosynthesis, mangrove fiddler crab ecology, reef diversity surveillance, and impacts of burrowing 
sponges. I also looked at how the structure of nacre changes with ocean temperatures between geological 
time periods (Gilbert, et al. 2017). As a volunteer at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, I
identified and sorted larval specimens, measured specimens, and updated the online database. While working 
on my senior thesis as an undergraduate, I looked at the relationship between scale morphology and ecology 
across species of fishes.
